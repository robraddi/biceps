## Reason for switching to Pandas DataFrame:

1. Quickly loads files 
2. Beautiful output
3. Reads and writes to and from [many file types](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/reference/io.html)
4. Stores information as pkl, which is a compressed format (saves space)

---------

`energy_model_1.txt`  <-- energy file to use as input
`new_CS_PF`           <-- pandas dataframes for input
`new_PF_CS`           <-- old text files for input (a new version should be able to except either)
`prep_cs.py`          <-- preparation file for getting pandas dataframes
`raw`                 <-- contains raw input data and jupyter notebook for setting up new_CS_PF
