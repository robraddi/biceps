Workflow
========

A typical BICePs sampling includes four core steps: `Preparation`, `Restraint`, `Posteriorsampler` and `Analysis`.

Preparation
-----------

The `Preparation` class converts all raw data to BICePs readable format. It asks for experimental data as well as correspondingly precomputed experimental observables from simulation. We recommend users to use [MDTraj](http://mdtraj.org) to compute all necessary experimental quantities from simulation or use our preparedfunctions in the `toolbox`. Check more details in the `examples <examples/index>` page. 

Restraint
---------

The `Restraint` class initializes all necessary functions to construct numpy array containing information for BICePs sampling. As a parent class, it also includes child classes for different experimental restraints.

Posteriorsampler
----------------

The `Posteriorsampler` class is closely working with the `Restraint` class. A Markov chain Monte Carlo sampling is performed based on the [Metroplis-Hastings criterion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metropolisâ€“Hastings_algorithm). 

Analysis
--------

The `Analysis` is consist of two parts:
1. Using [MBAR](https://pymbar.readthedocs.io/en/master/index.html) algorithm to compute populations and `BICePs scores <theory>`.
2. plot the figures to show population and `nuisance parameters <theory>`.
