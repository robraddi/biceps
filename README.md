BICePs - Bayesian Inference of Conformational Populations
=========================================================

The BICePs algorithm (Bayesian Inference of Conformational Populations)
is a statistically rigorous Bayesian inference method to reconcile
theoretical predictions of conformational state populations with sparse
and/or noisy experimental measurements and objectively compare different
models. Supported experimental observables include: 

- [NMR nuclear Overhauser effect (NOE)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_Overhauser_effect). 

- [NMR chemical shifts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_shift) (`HA`,`NH`, `CA` and `N`). 

- [J couplings](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J-coupling) (both small molecules and amino acids) 

- [Hydrogen--deuterium exchange (HDX)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydrogenâ€“deuterium_exchange).

Installation (in progress)
==========================

<!--
We recommend that you install `BICePs` with `conda`. :

```bash
    $ conda install -c conda-forge BICePs
```

You can install also `BICePs` with `pip`, if you prefer. :

```bash
    $ pip install BICePs
```
-->
<!--
Conda is a cross-platform package manager built especially for
scientific python. It will install `BICePs` along with all dependencies
from a pre-compiled binary. If you don\'t have Python or the `conda`
package manager, we recommend starting with the [Anaconda Scientific
Python distribution \<https://store.continuum.io/cshop/anaconda/\>](),
which comes pre-packaged with many of the core scientific python
packages that BICePs uses (see below), or with the [Miniconda Python
distribution](http://conda.pydata.org/miniconda.html), which is a
bare-bones Python installation.
-->

BICePs supports Python 2.7 or Python 3.4+ (coming soon) on Mac, Linux,
and Windows.
