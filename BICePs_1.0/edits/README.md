# BICePs Edits:
### This folder contains some edits that can potentially be implemented into the master code. Please refer to 'Notes.ipynb'.

#### Plan:
  * Need to finish editing structure.py and restraint.py 
  * After the latter is completed, focus on numpy and scipy methods.  Use python functions like timeit, etc... to test the speed of various forms of code to see what's most efficient.
