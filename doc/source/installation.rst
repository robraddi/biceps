Installation
============

We recommend that you install ``BICePs`` with ``pip``. ::

  $ pip install biceps


Coming soon: ::

  $ conda install -c conda-forge biceps



Conda is a cross-platform package manager built especially for scientific
python. It will install ``BICePs`` along with all dependencies from a
pre-compiled binary. If you don't have Python or the ``conda`` package
manager, we recommend starting with the `Anaconda Scientific Python
distribution <https://store.continuum.io/cshop/anaconda/>`_, which comes
pre-packaged with many of the core scientific python packages that BICePs
uses (see below), or with the `Miniconda Python distribution <http://conda.pydata.org/miniconda.html>`_,
which is a bare-bones Python installation.

BICePs supports Python 2.7 or Python 3.4+ (coming soon) on Mac, Linux, and
Windows.
