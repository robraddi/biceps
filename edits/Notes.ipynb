    "# Goals of BICePs:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Flexibility** (Organization is required)\n",
    "  * Ability to add various types of experimental data and restraints whenever we please.\n",
    "    \n",
    "2. **Efficiency/Memory**\n",
    "  * Power to run quickly, regardless of the amount of input data.\n",
    "  * Parallelization on time consuming steps?\n",
    "    - Operating System dependent (requires Linux or Unix in most cases)\n",
    "    - > [scipy](https://scipy.github.io/old-wiki/pages/ParallelProgramming) - As the saying goes, **\"premature optimization is the root of all evil\"**. Using a multicore machine will provide at best a speedup by a factor of the number of cores available. Get your code working first, before even thinking about parallelization. Then ask yourself whether your code actually needs to be any faster. Don't embark on the bug-strewn path of parallelization unless you have to. \n",
    "  * Storing in memory only when necessary. \n",
    "\n",
    "3. **User-friendly**\n",
    "  * sample_script.py should be easy to read/write\n",
    "  * Users should be prompt with sufficient messages when program is running.\n",
    "  * ```Help()``` should be informative - clear & concise.\n",
    "  * Argparse \n",
